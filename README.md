# My water is down again!

This is a silly project that hopes to prove some regions in Auckland get more water outages than others (I swear I don't live that rurally!)

Unfortunately there is no public API for previous water outages, so the data collected by this is incomplete.

But one day, I'll prove it! Maybe.

Project still a work in progress.
