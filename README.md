# My water is down again!

This is a silly project that hopes to prove some regions in Auckland get more water outages than others (I swear I don't live that rurally!)

Unfortunately there is no public API for previous water outages, so the data collected by this is largely incomplete.

But one day, I'll prove it! Maybe.

## APIs

There is only one API, available at the root of the server.

It comes with the following (query) parameters:
- outage_type
- start_date (after)
- end_date (before)
- suburb
- street
- location

Data is collected hourly.

## Installation instructions

TBA

## Live version
