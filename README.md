# My water is down again!

This is a silly project that hopes to prove some regions in Auckland get more water outages than others (I swear! We once got 4 that year, and we don't live rurally or anything!)

Unfortunately there is no public API for previous water outages, so the data collected by this is incomplete.

But one day, I'll prove it! Maybe.

Project still a work in progress.
